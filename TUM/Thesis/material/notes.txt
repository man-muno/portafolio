In order to be cognizant of their contexts, the smart environment needs to minimize this uncertainty as captured by Shannon’s entropy measure [18]. An analysis of the inhabitant’s daily routine and life style reveals that there exist some well-de?ned patterns. Although these patterns may change over time, they are not too frequent or random, and can thus be learned. This simple observation may lead us to assume that the inhabitant’s mobility or activity follows a piecewise
stationary, stochastic, ergodic process with an associated uncertainty (entropy), as originally proposed by Bhattacharya and Das [11] for optimally tracking (estimating and predicting) the location of mobile users in wireless cellular networks. [11] A. Bhattacharya, S.K. Das, Lezi-update: An information-theoretic approach for personal mobility tracking in pcs networks, Wireless Networks 8 (2002) 121–135. Hypothesizing that the inhabitant’s mobility has repetitive patterns that can be learned, and assuming the mobility as a stochastic random process, the following lower bound result was proven [11]: It is impossible to optimally track mobility with less information [11] A. Bhattacharya, S.K. Das, Lezi-update: An information-theoretic approach for personal mobility tracking
in pcs networks, Wireless Networks 8 (2002) 121–135. 
given the past observations of the inhabitant’s position and the best possible predictors of future position, some uncertainty in the position will always exist unless the device and the system exchange location information location tracking of multiple inhabitants is NP-hard [81] N.

Decision making
Few fully-implemented applications of decision-making technologies have been reported. One of the ?rst is the Adaptive Home [61], which uses a neural network and a reinforcement learner to determine ideal settings for lights and fans in the home. [61] M.C.
