  Abstract                 = {Intrusion detection systems have been widely used to overcome security threats in computer networks and to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems. Anomaly-based approaches in intrusion detection systems have the advantage of being able to detect unknown attacks; they look for patterns that deviate from the normal behavior. We have proposed an approach of anomaly intrusion detection system by using Gaussian mixture model. This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements. Experimental results show that this method is able to reducing the missing alarm. Moreover, this model is a fast method for detecting the unknown attacks.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Advances in ubiquitous computing, smart homes, and sensor technologies enable novel, longitudinal health monitoring applications in the home. Many home monitoring technologies have been proposed to detect health crises, support aging-in-place, and improve medical care. Health professionals and potential end users in the lay public, however, sometimes question whether home health monitoring is justified given the cost and potential invasion of privacy. Objective: The aim of the study was to elicit specific feedback from health professionals and laypeople about how they might use longitudinal health monitoring data for proactive health and well-being. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 8 health professionals and 26 laypeople. Participants were asked to evaluate mock data visualization displays that could be generated by novel home monitoring systems. The mock displays were used to elicit reactions to longitudinal monitoring in the home setting as well as what behaviors, events, and physiological indicators people were interested in tracking. Results: Based on the qualitative data provided by the interviews, lists of benefits of and concerns about health tracking from the perspectives of the practitioners and laypeople were compiled. Variables of particular interest to the interviewees, as well as their specific ideas for applications of collected data, were documented. Conclusions: Based upon these interviews, we recommend that ubiquitous ``monitoring'' systems may be more readily adopted if they are developed as tools for personalized, longitudinal self-investigation that help end users learn about the conditions and variables that impact their social, cognitive, and physical health. },

In 2000 police responded to 36 million false calls at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion. This paper presents and evaluates ten police policies for dealing with this waste of police resources. The paper then suggests that a public–private partnership will yield the highest net social benefits and avoids undesired cross subsidization. It further shows that implementation of a market oriented economic model where the police fulfill merely their public obligation is preferred to intuitive solutions that are often used by police. },

  Abstract                 = {With the growth of networked computers and associated applications, intrusion detection has become essential to keeping networks secure. A number of intrusion detection methods have been developed for protecting computers and networks using conventional statistical methods as well as data mining methods. Data mining methods for misuse and anomaly-based intrusion detection, usually encompass supervised, unsupervised and outlier methods. It is necessary that the capabilities of intrusion detection methods be updated with the creation of new attacks. This paper proposes a multi-level hybrid intrusion detection method that uses a combination of supervised, unsupervised and outlier-based methods for improving the efficiency of detection of new and old attacks. The method is evaluated with a captured real-time flow and packet dataset called the Tezpur University intrusion detection system (TUIDS) dataset, a distributed denial of service dataset, and the benchmark intrusion dataset called the knowledge discovery and data mining Cup 1999 dataset and the new version of KDD (NSL-KDD) dataset. Experimental results are compared with existing multi-level intrusion detection methods and other classifiers. The performance of our method is very good.},
