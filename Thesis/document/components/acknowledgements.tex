Many have sported me one way or the other to while writing these thesis. If I fail to mention your name, it is does not represent how grateful and lucky I am for having your support. 

I would specially like to thank my adviser Stefan Nosovi\'{c}. His constant support, encouragement, and willingness to discuss ideas greatly helped me during the process of writing my thesis. I also would like to thank Professor Bernd Bruegge for the chance to develop this work in the chair of the university that I believe to be the coolest. Furthermore, his feedback greatly enhanced my understanding of the problem at hand.

I also would like to thank my family in my mother tongue. If you do not understand Spanish, please do not take it personally. The gist of it is that they are awesome and I could not be here without them.\\
A mi familia muchas gracias por todo el apoyo que me han brindado desde la distancia. Sus constantes palabras de \'{a}nimo y sobretodo su ejemplo de perseverancia, han influido mucho la persona que soy hoy en d\'{i}a.
