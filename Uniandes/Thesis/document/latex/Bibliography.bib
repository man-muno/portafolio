  abstract = {In this paper, we present an overview of our recent research on programming
	language expressivity. The goal of this work is to make it possible
	for programs to clearly capture all of the important aspects of a
	system's behavior, including not only its functionality, but also
	issues such as its failure handling strategy, its communication strategy,
	its coordination strategy, its memory reference locality, etc. Our
	current work is based on the belief that programming languages based
	on any SINGLE abstraction framework---procedures, constraints, whatever---are
	ultimately inadequate for many complex systems. The reason is that
	the different aspects of a system's behavior that must be programmed,
	each tend to have their own \&quot;natural form\&quot;, so while
	one abstraction framework might do a good job of capturing one aspect,
	it will do a less good job capturing others. This conclusion has
	led us to develop a concept we call Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
	In AOP, the different aspects of a system's behavior are each programmed
	in their most natural form, and then these separate programs are
	woven together to produce executable code. Our work on AOP is being
	carried out in the context of both general-purpose and domainspecific
	languages, we believe that it has contributions to make to both areas.},

  abstract = {Aspect-oriented languages provide means to superimpose aspectual behavior
	on a given set of join points. It is possible that not just a single,
	but several units of aspectual behavior need to be superimposed on
	the same join point. Aspects that specify the superimposition of
	these units are said to "share" the same join point. Such shared
	join points may give rise to issues such as determining the exact
	execution order and the dependencies among the aspects. In this paper,
	we present a detailed analysis of the problem, and identify a set
	of requirements upon mechanisms for composing aspects at shared join
	points. To address the identified issues, we propose a general and
	declarative model for defining constraints upon the possible compositions
	of aspects at a shared join point. Finally, by using an extended
	notion of join points, we show how concrete aspectoriented programming
	languages, particularly AspectJ and Compose*, can adopt the proposed
	model.},

  abstract = {Aspect Oriented Software Development has been proposed as a means
	to improve modularization of software in the presence of crosscutting
	concerns. Compared to object-oriented or procedural approaches, Aspect
	Oriented Programming (AOP) has not yet been applied in many industrial
	applications. In this thesis we investigate the application of AOP
	within an industrial context and propose a novel solution to the
	problem of behavioral conflicts between aspects.
	
	We report on our experience transferring an aspect-oriented solution
	to a company called Advanced Semi-conductor Material Lithography
	(ASML). We investigate the acceptance criteria for AOP in industry,
	based on two industrial cases studies. We present a process that
	includes quantification of the benefits of AOP and elicitation of
	key worries expressed by stakeholders.
	
	We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the advantages and
	disadvantages of an aspect-based approach using a tracing example.
	Twenty developers from ASML were requested to carry out five maintenance
	scenarios. This experiment has shown that, in case the tracing concern
	is implemented using an AOP implementation instead of a procedural
	language, the development effort is on average 6\% reduced while
	the impact of errors is reduced by 77\%, for maintaining code related
	to tracing. For a subset of the scenarios, the results were statistically
	significant on a confidence interval of 95\%.
	
	The so-called aspect interference problem is one of the major concerns
	in introducing AOP. Aspects can be developed independently and behave
	correct in isolation. However, due to intended or unintended composition
	of aspects, undesired behavior can emerge. In this thesis we focus
	on behavioral conflicts between aspects at shared join points. These
	are illustrated by a realistic example based on crosscutting concerns
	from ASML. We present an approach for the detection of behavioral
	interference that is based on a novel abstraction of the behavior
	of aspects, using resources and operations. This abstraction enables
	the expression of behavior in a simple manner that is suitable for
	automated detection of interference among aspects. The approach employs
	a set of conflict detection rules that can be used to detect both
	generic conflicts as well as domain specific conflicts.
	
	Our approach is general for AOP languages, its application to one
	specific AOP language Composition Filters is also illustrated in
	this thesis. The application to Composition Filters demonstrates
	how the use of a declarative advice language can be exploited for
	automated conflict detection. We detail the analysis process and
	discuss what information is required from the aspect developer to
	be able perform the analysis. We also discuss when static analysis
	is insufficient for detecting behavioral conflicts. We present a
	run time extension aiming at detecting dynamic conflicts. We discuss
	optimizations for this run time approach, which exploits the static
	verification results.
	
	Finally, we propose three improvements to the Composition Filters
	model to support automated and manual reasoning even further. The
	first improvement separates what behavior is executed from when this
	behavior is executed. Secondly, we introduce atomic filters that
	can be used to build more complex filters. The semantics of these
	filters are well defined. Although this approach has clear benefits
	from an automated reasoning perspective, the introduction of atomic
	filters results in the definition of numerous filters for specifying
	more complex behavior. Therefore, we introduce a filter composition
	language that enables the declarative composition of (atomic) filters,
	such that composed filter behavior can be reused elsewhere.},
